# Money Bot

## Description
This is a discord bot that uses the hypixel skyblock api (at api.hypixel.net) to gather price, value, and names of bazaar and auction items. Using the command prefix ```$```.

* You can get a list of all items in the hypixel skyblock bazaar by using the command ```$items```.

* You can get the price and value of all items in skyblock by using the commands ```$allprices``` and ```$allvalues``` respectively.

* You can view the specific item price and value of an item in the skyblock bazaar by using the commands ```$price arg``` and ```$value arg``` respectively. 

* Finally, you can get the ah price of an item by using the command ```$ahprice arg```. 

NOTE: arg is replaced by the item name eg. builder's wand (not case sensitive)
