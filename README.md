# Money Bot

## Description
This is a discord bot that uses the hypixel skyblock api (at api.hypixel.net) and python to perform various commands to help with making money in the game, prefix: ```$```.
The commands you can use are as follows:

* You can get a list of all items in the hypixel skyblock bazaar by using the command ```$items```.

* You can get the price and value of all items in skyblock by using the commands ```$allprices``` and ```$allvalues``` respectively.

* You can view the specific item price and value of an item in the skyblock bazaar by using the commands ```$price arg``` and ```$value arg``` respectively. 

* You can use the command ```$gt money``` (replacing money with an amount of coins within hypixel skyblock or all) to find out how many of each item you need to buy, how many __golden teeth__ it will produce, and how much profit you will make from the process. (time approximation can be included in the future)

* you can use the command ```$profit arg``` to find out the profit of an item in the bazaar

*you can use the command ```$margin arg``` to find out the profit margin (% difference of _sell_ over _buy_) of an item in the bazaar

* Additionally, you can get the ah price of an item by using the command ```$ahprice arg```. 

NOTE: arg is replaced by the item name eg. builder's wand (not case sensitive)
